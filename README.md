## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs in an Agile environment requires distinguishing between a user’s "wants" and a user's "needs."  "Wants" are a helpful feedback, "needs" define value.  This goes beyond identifying solutions and reqruires finding the root of the problem.

Needs --> Epic Goals --> Features --> User Stories

Through functional decomposition, needs are transformed into User Stories.  User Stories translate complex requirements into non-technical format to foster communication, collaboration, and transparency between the scrum Team and the Stakeholders.  This also ensures the development process has a focus on providing value, incrementally, at the end of each Sprint.
