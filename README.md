## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs in an Agile environment requires distinguishing between a user’s "wants" and a user's "needs."  "Wants" are a helpful feedback, "needs" define value.  This goes beyond identifying solutions and reqruires finding the root of the problem.

Needs --> Epic Goals --> Features --> User Stories

Through functional decomposition, needs are transformed into User Stories.  User Stories translate complex requirements into non-technical format to foster communication, collaboration, and transparency between the scrum Team and the Stakeholders.  This also ensures the development process has a focus on providing value, incrementally, at the end of each Sprint.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs using an Agile mindset.  I prioritize transparency, inspection, and adaptation over extensive planning.  Instead of defining all requirements at the beginning of the project, rolling-wave planning allows detailed decisions to be made as new information is available.  

In my future development work, I plan to incorporate Agile practices such as Test-Driven Development to ensure code quality and simplicity.  I also look forward to incorporating Sprint Retrospectives to enable continuous improvement, reflect on processes, and implement changes.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means taking collective ownership of the product rather than staying within my individual role.  Success is measured by the delivery of a valuable increment, and all team members share responsbility for achieving it.  Being a good team member means collaborating and assisting others when needed.  A good team member reflects the values of commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage to foster trust, accountability, and collaboration. With effective communicaiton and collaboration, teams can solve complex problems and deliver high-quality software.
