# SNHU CS-250 Agile & Scrum Portfolio Artifact

## Project Overview
This repository contains my Scrum-Agile artifact portfolio for **CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle at Southern New Hampshire University.** 

The final project centers on the formation of a Scrum Team tasked with developing a niche vacation booking system for SNHU Travel as part of an initiative to transition from a traditional Waterfall approach to Agile Project Management.

The SNHU Travel project applied the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle within an Agile-Scrum framework.  My artifact portfolio aims to demonstrate how requirements, development, testing, and review can be iteratively executed to deliver high-quality software.  The Retrospective and Scrum_Agile_Overview documents evaluate Agile versus Waterfall methodologies while highlighting iterative development, cross-functional collaboration, and communication. 

This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end Agile execution through high-level planning, backlog refinement, education, and final retrospective.

## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs in an Agile environment requires distinguishing between a user’s "wants" and a user's "needs."  "Wants" are a helpful feedback, "needs" define value.  This goes beyond identifying solutions and reqruires finding the root of the problem.

Needs --> Epic Goals --> Features --> User Stories

Through functional decomposition, needs are transformed into User Stories.  User Stories translate complex requirements into non-technical format to foster communication, collaboration, and transparency between the scrum Team and the Stakeholders.  This also ensures the development process has a focus on providing value, incrementally, at the end of each Sprint.
