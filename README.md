# SNHU CS-250 Agile & Scrum Portfolio Artifact

## Project Overview
This repository contains my Scrum-Agile artifact portfolio for **CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle at Southern New Hampshire University.** 

The final project centers on the formation of a Scrum Team tasked with developing a niche vacation booking system for SNHU Travel as part of an initiative to transition from a traditional Waterfall approach to Agile Project Management.

The SNHU Travel project applied the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle within an Agile-Scrum framework.  My artifact portfolio aims to demonstrate how requirements, development, testing, and review can be iteratively executed to deliver high-quality software.  The Retrospective and Scrum_Agile_Overview documents evaluate Agile versus Waterfall methodologies while highlighting iterative development, cross-functional collaboration, and communication. 

This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end Agile execution through high-level planning, backlog refinement, education, and final retrospective.
